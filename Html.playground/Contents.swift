When building server-side application in Swift it is important to be able to render HTML documents. The current best practice in the community is to use templating languages like Stencil, Mustache, Handlebars, Leaf and others. However, templating languages are inherently unsafe due to the API being stringly typed. The vast majority of errors that can arise in creating a template happen only at runtime, including typos and type mismatches.
"""),

Thatâ€™s unfortunate because we are used to working in Swift, which is strongly typed, and many potential bugs are discovered at compile time rather than runtime. Our approach is to instead embed HTML documents directly into Swift types so that we immediately get all of the features and safety Swift has to offer.
